# Kiro Development Log

I used Kiro to help me build my Simple Receipt Generator website.  
Below are the main steps where I used Kiro during development:

1. HTML Structure:  
I first asked Kiro to generate a basic HTML layout with the fields I needed for the receipt.  
Kiro gave me a clean form structure, which I copied into my `index.html` and adjusted a bit.

2. Styling (CSS):
Next, I asked Kiro for simple CSS to keep the page neat and readable.  
It suggested basic spacing, alignment, and a receipt preview box.  
I used that as the main style in `style.css`.

3. JavaScript Logic:
Finally, I used Kiro to write the JavaScript that updates the receipt preview and handles button actions.  
I pasted the code into `script.js` and tested it step by step.

The screenshots of these Kiro interactions are available inside the `/screenshots` folder.
