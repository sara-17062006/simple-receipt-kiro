# Simple Receipt Generator – Kiro Week 1 Micro-Tools Challenge
This project is built for the AI for Bharat – Kiro Week 1 Micro-Tools Challenge.  
The goal is to build a **single-purpose micro-tool** that solves one small everyday problem elegantly.
My tool is a Simple Receipt Generator that allows users to fill in receipt details, preview them instantly, and download a clean PDF version.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Creating simple receipts for small transactions—like tutoring fees, small business payments, event collections, or freelance work—is tedious.  
Most tools are too complex or require registration.

I wanted a quick, minimal, no-login, no-database receipt generator** anyone can use instantly.

## ✅ Solution: Simple Receipt Generator
This tool lets you:

- Enter receipt details  
- See a **live preview**
- Generate and **download PDF**
- Print the receipt directly  
- Use it offline  
- All in one clean, simple webpage  

Perfect for small business owners, students, freelancers, or anyone needing quick receipts.
